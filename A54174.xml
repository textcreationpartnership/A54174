         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Kind Friends;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Kindneſs of yours by the Ship <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Anne,</hi> doth much oblige me; for by it I perceive the Intereſt you take in my <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> and the <hi>proſperous Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> which you are ſo kind as to think may much depend upon them. In return of which, I have ſent you a long Letter, and yet containing as brief an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>My ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>Affairs</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> as I have been able to make.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I take notice of the <hi>News</hi> you ſent me, whereby I find ſome Perſons have had ſo little Wit, and ſo much Malice, as to report my <hi>Death,</hi> and to mend the matter, <hi>dead a Jeſuit too.</hi> One might have reaſonably hop'd, that this <hi>Diſtance,</hi> like <hi>Death,</hi> would have been a protection againſt <hi>Spite</hi> and <hi>Envy;</hi> and indeed, <hi>Abſence</hi> being a kind of <hi>Death,</hi> ought alike to ſecure the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Abſent</hi> as the <hi>Dead;</hi> becauſe they are equally unable as ſuch to defend themſelves: But they that intend <hi>Miſchief,</hi> do not uſe to follow <hi>good Rules</hi> to effect it. However, to the great Sorrow and Shame of the <hi>Inventors,</hi> I am ſtill <hi>Alive,</hi> and <hi>No Jeſuit,</hi> and I thank God, <hi>very well:</hi> And without Injuſtice to the Authors of this, I may venture to infer, That they that wilfully and falſly <hi>Report,</hi> would have been glad it had been <hi>So.</hi> But I perceive, many <hi>Idle Stories</hi> have been <hi>Invented</hi> ſince my Departure from <hi>England,</hi> which perhaps at this time are no more <hi>Alive,</hi> than I am <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if I have been <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindly</hi> uſed by ſome I left behind me, I found <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> enough where I came; an univerſal kind <hi>Welcome,</hi> every ſort in their way. For here are ſome of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Nations,</hi> as well as divers <hi>Judgments:</hi> Nor were the <hi>Natives</hi> wanting in this, for their <hi>Kings, Queens</hi> and <hi>Great Men</hi> both viſited and preſented me; to whom I made ſuitable Returns, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>PROVINCE,</hi> the general Condition of it take as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Country it ſelf in its <hi>Soyl, Air, Water, Seaſons</hi> and <hi>Produce</hi> both Natural and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial is not to be deſpiſed. The <hi>Land</hi> containeth divers ſorts of <hi>Earth,</hi> as <hi>Sand</hi> Yellow and Black, Poor and Rich: alſo <hi>Gravel</hi> both Loomy and Duſty; and in ſome places a <hi>faſt fat Earth,</hi> like to our beſt <hi>Vales</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially by <hi>Inland-Brooks</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> God in his Wiſdom having ordered it ſo, that the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> are divided, the <hi>Back-Lands</hi> being generally <hi>three</hi> to <hi>one Richer</hi> than thoſe that lie by <hi>Navigable Waters.</hi> We have much of another <hi>Soyl,</hi> and that is a <hi>black Haſel-Mould,</hi> upon a <hi>Stony</hi> or <hi>Rocky</hi> bottom.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Air</hi> is ſweet and clear, the Heavens ſerene, like the <hi>South-parts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> rarely <hi>Overcaſt;</hi> and as the <hi>Woods</hi> come by numbers of People to be more <hi>clear'd,</hi> that it ſelf will Refine.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Waters</hi> are generally good, for the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> have moſtly <hi>Gravel</hi> and <hi>Stony Bottoms,</hi> and in Number hardly credible. We have alſo <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> that operate in the ſame manner with <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>North-hall,</hi> not two Miles from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. For the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year, having by God's goodneſs now lived over the <hi>Coldeſt</hi> and <hi>Hotteſt,</hi> that the <hi>Oldeſt Liver</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> can remember, I can ſay ſomething to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, Of the <hi>Fall,</hi> for then I came in: I found it from the 24th of <hi>October,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> as we have it uſually in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> or rather like an <hi>Engliſh mild Spring.</hi> From <hi>December</hi> to the beginning of the Moneth called <hi>March,</hi> we had <hi>ſharp Froſty Weather,</hi> not foul, thick, black Weather, as our <hi>North-Eaſt Winds</hi> bring with them in <hi>England;</hi> but a Skie as clear as in <hi>Summer,</hi> and the Air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more <hi>Clothes</hi> than in <hi>England.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>Cold</hi> is given from the great <hi>Lakes</hi> that are fed by the <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Canada.</hi> The <hi>Winter</hi> before was as <hi>mild,</hi> ſcarce any <hi>Ice</hi> at all; while this for a <hi>few dayes Froze</hi> up our great River <hi>Delaware.</hi> From that Moneth to the Moneth called <hi>June,</hi> we enjoy'd a <hi>ſweet Spring,</hi> no <hi>Guſts,</hi> but <hi>gentle Showers,</hi> and a fine Skie. Yet this I obſerve, that the <hi>Winds</hi> here as there, are more Inconſtant <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall,</hi> upon that turn of Nature, than in <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Winter.</hi> From thence to this preſent, Moneth, which endeth the <hi>Summer</hi> (commonly ſpeaking) we have had <hi>extraordinary Heats</hi> yet mitigated ſometimes by <hi>Cool Br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ezese.</hi> The <hi>Wind</hi> that ruleth the <hi>Summer-ſeaſon,</hi> is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108140:3"/>
               <hi>South-Weſt;</hi> but <hi>Spring, Fall</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> 'tis rare to want the <hi>wholeſome North Weſter</hi> ſeven dayes together: And what-ever <hi>Miſts, Fogs</hi> or <hi>Vapours</hi> foul the Heavens by <hi>Eaſterly</hi> or <hi>Southerly Winds,</hi> in two Hours time are blown away; the <hi>one</hi> is alwayes followed by the <hi>other:</hi> A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that ſeems to have a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of <hi>Trees,</hi> yet ſtanding, being liable to retain <hi>Miſts</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> and yet not one quarter ſo <hi>thick</hi> as I expected.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The <hi>Natural Produce</hi> of the Country, of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> is <hi>Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers.</hi> The <hi>Trees</hi> of moſt note are, the <hi>black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Cheſtnut, Poplar, Gumwood, Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, Saſſafrax, Aſh, Beech</hi> and <hi>Oak</hi> of divers ſorts, as <hi>Red, White</hi> and <hi>Black; Spaniſh Cheſtnut</hi> and <hi>Swamp,</hi> the moſt durable of all: of <hi>All</hi> which there is plenty for the uſe of man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fruits</hi> that I find in the <hi>Woods,</hi> are the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black Mulbery, Cheſtnut, Wallnut, Plumbs, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi> of divers ſorts. The great <hi>Red Grape</hi> (now ripe) called by Ignorance, the <hi>Fox-Grape</hi> (becauſe of the Reliſh it hath with unskilful Palates) is in it ſelf an extraordinary <hi>Grape,</hi> and by Art doubtleſs may be Cultivated to an excellent <hi>Wine,</hi> if not ſo ſweet, yet little inferior to the <hi>Frontiniack,</hi> as it is not much unlike in taſte, Ruddineſs ſet aſide, which in ſuch things, as well as Mankind, differs the caſe much. There is a <hi>white</hi> kind of <hi>Muskedel,</hi> and a little <hi>black Grape,</hi> like the Cluſter-Grape of <hi>England,</hi> not yet ſo ripe as the other; but they tell me, when Ripe, ſweeter, and that they only want skilful <hi>Vinerons</hi> to make good uſe of them: I intend to venture on it with my <hi>French-man</hi> this ſeaſon, who ſhews ſome knowledge in thoſe things. Here are alſo <hi>Peaches,</hi> and very good, and in great quantities, not an <hi>Indian Plantation</hi> without them; but whether naturally here at firſt, I know not, however one may have them by <hi>Buſhels</hi> for little; they make a pleaſant <hi>Drink</hi> and I think not inferior to any <hi>Peach</hi> you have in <hi>England,</hi> except the true <hi>Newington.</hi> 'Tis diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with me, whether it be beſt to fall to <hi>Fining</hi> the Fruits of the Country, eſpecially the <hi>Grape,</hi> by the care and skill of Art, or ſend for <hi>forreign Stems</hi> and <hi>Sets,</hi> already good and approved: It ſeems moſt reaſonable to believe, that not only a thing groweth beſt, where it naturally grows; but will hardly be equalled by another <hi>Species</hi> of the ſame kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to <hi>ſolve</hi> the doubt, I intend, if God give me Life, to try <hi>both,</hi> and hope the conſequence will be as <hi>good Wine</hi> as any <hi>European</hi> Countries of the ſame Latitude do yield.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Artificial Produce</hi> of the Country, is <hi>Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Peaſe, Beans, Squaſhes, Pumkins,</hi>
               <note>Note, that <hi>Edward Jones,</hi> Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law to <hi>Thomas Wynn,</hi> living on the <hi>Schulkil,</hi> had with ordinary Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, for one <hi>one Grain</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Barley, ſeventy Stalks</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> of <hi>Barley;</hi> And 'tis common in this Country from <hi>one Buſhel</hi> ſown, to reap <hi>forty,</hi> often <hi>fifty,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>ſixty.</hi> And three <hi>Pecks</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi> ſows an <hi>Acre</hi> here.</note>

            <p n="7">VII. Of living Creatures; <hi>Fiſh, Fowl,</hi> and the Beaſts of the Woods, here are divers ſorts, ſome for Food and Profit, and ſome for Profit only: For Food as well as Profit, the <hi>Elk,</hi> as big as a ſmall <hi>Ox, Deer</hi> bigger than ours, <hi>Beaver, Racoon, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, Squirrels,</hi> and ſome eat young <hi>Bear,</hi> and commend it. Of <hi>Fowl</hi> of the Land, there is the <hi>Turkey</hi> (Forty and Fifty Pound weight) which is very great; <hi>Pheſants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons</hi> and <hi>Partridges</hi> in abundance. Of the Water, the <hi>Swan, Gooſe,</hi> white and gray, <hi>Brands, Ducks, Teal,</hi> alſo the <hi>Snipe</hi> and <hi>Curloe,</hi> and that in great Numbers; but the <hi>Duck</hi> and <hi>Teal</hi> excel, nor ſo good have I ever eat in other Countries. Of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> there is the <hi>Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Catſhead, Sheepſhead, Ele, Smelt, Pearch, Roach;</hi> and in Inland Rivers, <hi>Trout,</hi> ſome ſay <hi>Salmon,</hi> above the Falls. Of <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh,</hi> we have <hi>Oyſters, Crabbs, Cockles, Concks</hi> and <hi>Muſhels;</hi> ſome <hi>Oyſters ſix Inches</hi> long, and one ſort of <hi>Cockles</hi> as big as the Stewing <hi>Oyſters,</hi> they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for Profit only by <hi>Skin</hi> or <hi>Fur,</hi> and that are natural to theſe parts, are the <hi>Wild Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fiſher, Minx, Musk-Rat;</hi> and of the Water, the <hi>Whale</hi> for <hi>Oyl,</hi> of which we have good ſtore, and two Companies of <hi>Whalers,</hi> whoſe Boats are built, will ſoon begin their Work, which hath the appearance of a conſiderable Improvement.

            <p n="8">VIII. We have no want of <hi>Horſes,</hi> and ſome are very good and ſhapely enough; two Ships have been freighted to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with <hi>Horſes</hi> and <hi>Pipe-Staves,</hi> ſince my coming in.

            <p n="9">IX. There are divers <hi>Plants</hi> that not only the <hi>Indians</hi> tell us, but we have had occaſion to prove by <hi>Swellings, Burnings, Cuts,</hi> &amp;c. that they are of great Virtue, ſuddenly curing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: and for <hi>ſmell,</hi> I have obſerved ſeveral, eſpecially one, the <hi>wild Mirtle;</hi> the other I know not what to call, but are moſt <hi>fragrant.</hi>

The <hi>NATIVES</hi> I shall conſider in their <hi>Perſons, Language, Manners, Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> with my ſence of their <hi>Original.</hi> For their <hi>Perſons,</hi> they are generally tall, ſtreight, well-built, and of ſingular Proportion; they tread ſtrong and clever, and moſtly walk with a lofty Chin: Of Complexion, <hi>Black,</hi> but by deſign, as the <hi>Gypſies</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> They greaſe themſelves with Bears-ſat clarified, and uſing no defence againſt <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Weather,</hi> their skins muſt needs be ſwarthy: Their <hi>Eye</hi> is little and black, not unlike a ſtraight-look't <hi>Jew:</hi> The <hi>thick Lip</hi> and <hi>flat Noſe,</hi> ſo frequent with the <hi>Eaſt-Indians</hi> and <hi>Blacks,</hi> are not common to them; for I have ſeen as comely <hi>European-like faces</hi> among them of both, as on your ſide the Sea; and truly an <hi>Italian Complexion</hi> hath not much more of the <hi>White,</hi> and the <hi>Noſes</hi> of ſeveral of them have as much of the <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. Their <hi>Language</hi> is lofty, yet narrow, but like the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> in Signification full, like <hi>Short-hand</hi> in writing; <hi>one</hi> word ſerveth in the place of <hi>three,</hi> and the reſt are ſupplied by the Underſtanding of the Hearer: Imperfect in their <hi>Tenſes,</hi> wanting in their <hi>Moods, Participles, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections:</hi> I have made it my buſineſs to underſtand it, that I might not want an Interpreter on any occaſion: And I muſt ſay, that I know not a Language ſpoken in <hi>Europe,</hi> that hath words of more ſweetneſs or greatneſs, in <hi>Accent</hi> and <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> than theirs; for Inſtance, <hi>Octorockon, Rancocas, Oricton, Shakamaron, Poqueſſin,</hi> all which are names of Places, and have Grandeur in them: Of words of Sweetneſs, <hi>Anna,</hi> is <hi>Mother, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> a Brother, <hi>Qetap,</hi> Friend, <hi>uſque oret,</hi> very good; <hi>pone,</hi> Bread, <hi>metſe,</hi> eat, <hi>matta,</hi> no, <hi>hatta,</hi> to have, <hi>payo,</hi> to come; <hi>Sepaſſen, Paſſion,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Of their <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> there is much to be ſaid; I will begin with <hi>Children.</hi> So ſoon as they are born, they waſh them in <hi>Water,</hi> and while very young, and in cold Weather to chuſe, they <hi>Plunge</hi> them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them. Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a ſtraight thin Board, a little more than the length and breadth of the Child, and ſwadle it faſt upon the Board to make it ſtraight; wherefore all <hi>Indians</hi> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs. The Children will go very <hi>young,</hi> at <hi>nine Moneths</hi> commonly; they wear only a ſmall Clout round their Waſte, till they are big; if <hi>Boys,</hi> they go a Fiſhing till ripe for the Woods, which is about <hi>Fifteen;</hi> then they Hunt, and after having given ſome Proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of <hi>Skins,</hi> they may <hi>Marry,</hi> elſe it is a shame to think of a <hi>Wife.</hi> The <hi>Girls</hi> ſtay with their Mothers, and help to hoe the Ground, plant Corn and carry Burthens; and they do well to uſe them to that <hi>Young,</hi> they muſt do when they are <hi>Old;</hi> for the <hi>Wives</hi> are the true <hi>Servants</hi> of their <hi>Husbands:</hi> otherwiſe the Men are very affectionate to them.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. When the <hi>Young Women</hi> are fit for <hi>Marriage,</hi> they wear ſomething upon their Heads for an Advertiſement, but ſo as their Faces are hardly to be ſeen, but when they pleaſe: The <hi>Age</hi> they <hi>Marry</hi> at, if <hi>Women,</hi> is about <hi>thirteen</hi> and <hi>fourteen;</hi> if <hi>Men, ſeventeen</hi> and <hi>eighteen;</hi> they are rarely elder.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Their <hi>Houſes</hi> are <hi>Mats,</hi> or <hi>Barks of Trees</hi> ſet on Poles, in the faſhion of an <hi>Engliſh Barn,</hi> but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a Man; they lie on <hi>Reeds</hi> or <hi>Graſs.</hi> In <hi>Travel</hi> they lodge in the <hi>Woods</hi> about a great Fire, with the Mantle of <hi>Duffills</hi> they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs ſtuck round them.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Their <hi>Diet</hi> is <hi>Maze,</hi> or <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> divers ways prepared; ſometimes <hi>Roaſted</hi> in the Aſhes, ſometimes beaten and <hi>Boyled</hi> with Water, which they call <hi>Homine;</hi> they alſo make <hi>Cakes,</hi> not unpleaſant to eat: They have likewiſe ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Beans</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> that are good Nouriſhment; and the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> are their <hi>Larder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII. If an <hi>European</hi> comes to ſee them, or calls for Lodging at their Houſe or <hi>Wigwam,</hi> they give him the beſt place and firſt cut. If they come to viſit us, they ſalute us with an <hi>Itah,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Good be to you,</hi> and ſet them down, which is moſtly on the Ground, cloſe to their Heels, their Legs upright; may be they ſpeak not a word more, but obſerve all Paſſages: If you give them any thing to eat or drink, well, for they will not ask; and be it little or much, if it be with Kindneſs, they are well pleaſed, elſe they go away ſullen, but ſay nothing.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. They are great <hi>Concealers</hi> of their own <hi>Reſentments,</hi> brought to it, I believe, by the <hi>Revenge</hi> that hath been practiſed among them; in either of theſe, they are not exceeded by the <hi>Italians.</hi> A <hi>Tragical</hi> Inſtance fell out ſince I came into the Country; A <hi>King's Daughter</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf ſlighted by her Husband, in ſuffering another <hi>Woman</hi> to lie down between them, roſe up, went out, pluck't a Root out of the Ground, and ate it, upon which ſhe immediately dyed; and for which, laſt Week he made an <hi>Offering</hi> to her Kindred for <hi>Attonement</hi> and liberty of Marriage; as two others did to the Kindred of their Wives, that dyed a natural Death: For
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108140:4"/>till <hi>Widdowers</hi> have done ſo, they muſt not <hi>marry</hi> again. Some of the <hi>young Women</hi> are ſaid to take undue liberty before <hi>Marriage</hi> for a Portion; but when <hi>marryed,</hi> chaſte; when with Child, they know their Husbands no more, till delivered; and during their Moneth, they touch no <hi>Meat;</hi> they eat, but with a <hi>Stick,</hi> leaſt they should defile it; nor do their Husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. But in <hi>Liberality</hi> they excell, nothing is too good for their friend; give them a <hi>fine Gun, Coat,</hi> or other thing, it may paſs <hi>twenty hands,</hi> before it ſticks; <hi>light</hi> of Heart, <hi>ſtrong</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but ſoon ſpent; the moſt <hi>merry</hi> Creatures that live, <hi>Feaſt</hi> and <hi>Dance</hi> perpetually; they never have much, nor want much: <hi>Wealth</hi> circulateth like the <hi>Blood,</hi> all parts partake; and though none shall want what another hath, yet exact Obſervers of <hi>Property.</hi> Some <hi>Kings</hi> have ſold, others preſented me with ſeveral <hi>parcels</hi> of <hi>Land;</hi> the Pay or Preſents I made them, were <hi>not hoarded</hi> by the particular Owners, but the <hi>neighbouring Kings</hi> and their <hi>Clans</hi> being preſent when the Goods were brought out, the Parties chiefly concerned conſulted, what and to whom they ſhould give them? To every <hi>King</hi> then, by the hands of a Perſon for that work appointed, is a proportion ſent, ſo ſorted and folded, and with that <hi>Gravity,</hi> that is admirable. Then that <hi>King</hi> ſub-divideth it in like manner among his Dependents, they hardly leaving themſelves an <hi>Equal ſhare</hi> with one of their <hi>Subjects:</hi> and be it on ſuch occaſions, at <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> or at their <hi>common Meals,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> diſtribute, and to themſelves <hi>laſt.</hi> They care for <hi>little,</hi> becauſe they want but <hi>little;</hi> and the Reaſon is, a <hi>little</hi> contents them: In this they are ſufficiently revenged on us; if they are ignorant of our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> they are alſo free from our <hi>Pains.</hi> They are not diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Bills of Lading</hi> and <hi>Exchange,</hi> nor perplexed with <hi>Chancery-Suits</hi> and <hi>Exchequer-Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> We <hi>ſweat</hi> and <hi>toil</hi> to live; their <hi>pleaſure</hi> feeds them, I mean, their <hi>Hunting, Fiſhing</hi> and <hi>Fowling,</hi> and this Table is ſpread every where; they <hi>eat twice a day,</hi> Morning and Evening; their <hi>Seats</hi> and <hi>Table</hi> are the <hi>Ground.</hi> Since the <hi>Europeans</hi> came into theſe parts, they are grown great lovers of <hi>ſtrong Liquors, Rum</hi> eſpecially, and for it exchange the richeſt of their <hi>Skins</hi> and <hi>Furs:</hi> If they are heated with <hi>Liquors,</hi> they are reſtleſs till they have enough to <hi>ſleep;</hi> that is their cry, <hi>Some more, and I will go to ſleep;</hi> but when <hi>Drunk,</hi> one of the <hi>moſt wretchedſt Spectacles in the World.</hi>

            <p n="20">XX. In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> impatient to be cured, and for it give any thing, eſpecially for their <hi>Children,</hi> to whom they are extreamly natural; they drink at thoſe times a <hi>Teran</hi> or Decoction of ſome Roots in ſpring Water; and if they eat any <hi>fleſh,</hi> it muſt be of the <hi>Female</hi> of any Creature: If they dye, they bury them with their <hi>Apparel,</hi> be they <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Women,</hi> and the neareſt of <hi>Kin</hi> fling in ſomething precious with them, as a token of their Love: Their <hi>Mourning</hi> is <hi>blacking</hi> of their <hi>faces,</hi> which they continue for a <hi>year:</hi> They are choice of the <hi>Graves</hi> of their <hi>Dead;</hi> for leaſt they ſhould be loſt by time, and fall to common uſe, they <hi>pick off the Graſs</hi> that grows upon them, and heap up the fallen Earth with great care and exactneſs.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108140:4"/>too. 'Tis admirable to conſider, how <hi>Powerful</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> are, and yet how they move by the <hi>Breath</hi> of their <hi>People.</hi> I have had occaſion to be in <hi>Council</hi> with them upon <hi>Treaties</hi> for <hi>Land,</hi> and to adjuſt the terms of <hi>Trade;</hi> their Order is thus: The <hi>King</hi> ſits in the middle of an half Moon, and hath his <hi>Council,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> on each hand; behind them, or at a little diſtance, ſit the younger <hi>Fry,</hi> in the ſame figure.

            <p>So much for the <hi>Natives,</hi> next the <hi>Old Planters</hi> will be conſidered in this Relation, before I come to our <hi>Colony,</hi> and the Concerns of it.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII.

Our People are moſtly ſettled upon the upper Rivers, which are pleaſant and ſweet, and generally bounded with good Land.

            <byline>By the Surveyor General.</byline>
            <p>THe City of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> now extends in <hi>Length,</hi> from River to River, <hi>two Miles,</hi> and in <hi>Breadth</hi> near a <hi>Mile;</hi> and the <hi>Governour,</hi> as a further manifeſtation of his Kindneſs to the <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> hath freely given them their reſpective <hi>Lots</hi> in the City, without defalcation of any their <hi>Quantities</hi> of <hi>purchaſed Lands;</hi> and as its now placed and modelled between <hi>two Navigable Rivers</hi> upon a Neck of Land, and that Ships may ride in good <hi>Anchorage,</hi> in <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>eight Fathom Water</hi> in both Rivers, cloſe to the City, and the Land of the City level, dry and wholſom; ſuch a <hi>Scituation</hi> is ſcarce to be parallel'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> appears by a ſmall <hi>Draught</hi> now made, and may hereafter, when time permits, be augmented; and becauſe there is not room to expreſs the <hi>Purchaſers Names</hi> in the <hi>Draught,</hi> I have therefore drawn <hi>Directions</hi> of <hi>Reference,</hi> by way of <hi>Numbers,</hi> whereby may be known each mans <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> in the <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>City</hi> is ſo ordered now, by the <hi>Governour's Care</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> that it hath a <hi>Front</hi> to each <hi>River,</hi> one half at <hi>Delaware,</hi> the other at <hi>Skulkill;</hi> and though all this cannot make way for <hi>ſmall Purchaſers</hi> to be in the <hi>Fronts,</hi> yet they are placed in the <hi>next Streets,</hi> contiguous to each <hi>Front, viz.</hi> all Purchaſers of <hi>one Thouſand Acres,</hi> and upwards, have the <hi>Fronts</hi> (and the <hi>High-ſtreet</hi>) and to every <hi>five Thouſand Acres Purchaſe,</hi> in the <hi>Front</hi> about an <hi>Acre,</hi> and the <hi>ſmaller Purchaſers</hi> about <hi>half an Acre</hi> in the <hi>backward Street;</hi> by which means the leaſt hath room enough for <hi>Houſe, Garden</hi> and <hi>ſmall Orchard,</hi> to the great Content and Satisfaction of all here concerned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>City</hi> (as the <hi>Model</hi> ſhews) conſiſts of a <hi>large Front-ſtreet</hi> to each River, and a <hi>High-ſtreet</hi> (near the middle) from <hi>Front</hi> (or River) to <hi>Front,</hi> of <hi>one hundred foot broad,</hi> and <hi>a broad Street</hi> in the middle of the City, from <hi>ſide</hi> to <hi>ſide,</hi> of the like breadth. In the Center of the City, is a <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Ten Acres;</hi> at each Angle are to be Houſes for <hi>publick Affairs,</hi> as a <hi>Meeting-Houſe, Aſſembly</hi> or <hi>State-Houſe, Market-Houſe, School-Houſe,</hi> and ſeveral other Buildings for <hi>Publick Concerns.</hi> There are alſo in each Quarter of the City, a <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>eight Acres,</hi> to be for the like Uſes, as the <hi>Moor-fields</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>eight Streets</hi> (beſides the ſaid <hi>High-ſtreet</hi>) that run from <hi>front</hi> to <hi>front,</hi> and <hi>twenty Streets</hi> (beſides the <hi>broad-ſtreet</hi>) that run croſs the City, from <hi>ſide</hi> to <hi>ſide;</hi> all theſe Streets are of <hi>fifty Foot breadth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In each <hi>Number</hi> in the <hi>Draught,</hi> in the <hi>Fronts</hi> and <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> are placed the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> of <hi>One Thouſand Acres,</hi> and upwards, to make up <hi>five Thouſand Acres Lot,</hi> both in the ſaid <hi>Fronts</hi> and <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> and the <hi>Numbers</hi> direct to each <hi>Lot,</hi> and where in the City; ſo that thereby they may know, where their Concerns are therein.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Front Lots</hi> begin at the <hi>South-ends</hi> of the <hi>Fronts,</hi> by the <hi>Numbers,</hi> and ſo reach to the <hi>North-ends,</hi> and end at <hi>Number</hi> 43. The <hi>Hight-ſtreet Lots</hi> begin towards the <hi>Fronts</hi> at <hi>Number</hi> 44. and ſo reach to the Center.</p>
            <p>The <hi>leſſer Purchaſers</hi> begin at <hi>Number</hi> 1. in the <hi>ſecond Streets,</hi> and ſo proceed by the <hi>Numbers,</hi> as in the <hi>Draught;</hi> the <hi>biggeſt</hi> of them being <hi>firſt placed,</hi> neareſt to the <hi>Fronts.</hi>
